# MITgcm.jl

Tools for using [MITgcm](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) or analyzing its output. This includes not only manipulating model inputs and outputs, but also compiling and running the model. Much of the functionalities are documented via the [Examples](@ref) section, as highlighted hereafter.

[ClimateModels.jl](https://gaelforget.github.io/ClimateModels.jl/stable/) provides a standard interface for such workflows. Related packages also include [MeshArrays.jl](https://juliaclimate.github.io/MeshArrays.jl/dev/) defining in-memory containters for gridded model output, and [IndividualDisplacements.jl](https://juliaclimate.github.io/IndividualDisplacements.jl/dev/) enabling particle tracking applications. 

## Main Features

- Scan / Read / Write MITgcm Files
- Standard MITgcm configurations
- Climate Model Interface
- [Examples](@ref) (notebooks in `examples/`)
